# CS350_Emerging_Sys_Arch_-_Tech
Culmination of work from SNHU's CS350 Course: Emerging System Architecture and Technology (Embedded Systems). 

## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project focused on developing a prototype for a smart thermostat. The goal was to create a device that could measure room temperature with a sensor, allow users to adjust the temperature via buttons, and send this data to a server. This initial step was essential for SysTec's plans to enter the smart thermostat market.

## What did you do particularly well?
I excelled at integrating various technologies to ensure the thermostat functioned smoothly. Particularly, the seamless interaction between the temperature sensor, user input buttons, and server communication via UART highlighted my strong capability in managing and implementing complex systems.

## Where could you improve?
I see potential for improvement in enhancing the system's power management and expanding the error handling mechanisms. These enhancements would make the thermostat more efficient and reliable, especially in unexpected scenarios.

## What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
Throughout this project, I've grown more proficient with the TI Code Composer Studio and deepened my understanding of I2C and UART protocols. These tools and knowledge are crucial additions to my professional toolkit, supporting my growth in embedded systems design.

## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The skills in hardware-software integration and systematic troubleshooting are highly transferable. These abilities are valuable across various fields in technology, especially in roles that involve IoT devices and embedded systems.

## How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
By employing a modular design and clear commenting, the project's codebase is easy to maintain and adapt for future enhancements. Each component (like UART and GPIO setups) is encapsulated in its function, which simplifies modifications and ensures the system remains accessible for other developers and for future expansion.
